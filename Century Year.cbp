3.	Def: A year is a century year if it is divisible by 100. (Ex. 100, 200, 300,...)
Def: A year is non-century year if it is not a century year. (Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
Def: A year is a leap year if it is a non-century year that is divisible by 4, or 
a century year that is divisible by 400. Nothing else is a leap year. 

Write a program that is going to ask the user for the range of years and print out 
all leap years in that range 5 to a line. You must write a separate function to check 
if the given year is a leap year or not and then call this function in your main 
function that prints all leap years in that range. Name your program file as 
leapyears.cpp
